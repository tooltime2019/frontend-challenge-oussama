# Frontend Challenge 

Thank you very much for investing your time in the recruitment process of ToolTime. If you have questions, feel free to ask at any time.

## Outline
Please build a web application that lets users vote through the Polls API.
Documentation for the API is available at https://pollsapi.docs.apiary.io/. Refer to the
documentation for details on how to query the API.

## [Features]
- [List of questions page](resources/1-questions-page.jpeg)
- [Question detail page](resources/2-question-detail-page.jpeg)
- Bonus feature: Create new question page

## Notes
- You can use any JS frameworks or VanillaJS.
- You can use starter projects such as [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- Focus on good application structure, not a hacky solution.
- Your solution needs to be responsive, it should work on small and large screens.
